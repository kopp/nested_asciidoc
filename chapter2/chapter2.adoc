== Chapter 2

This is chapter 2.

And here is an image:

image::images/bar.jpg[bar image]

And this is behind the image.

And this is a sub-chapter, included in this chapter:

currently, imagesdir is {imagesdir}


ifndef::imagesdir[]
:imagesdir: .
endif::[]
:imagesdir: {imagesdir}/chapter2a

now it was changed to {imagesdir} in order to include something from there.

WARNING: You will need something similar to the construct above to correctly nest documents.

include::chapter2a/chapter2a.adoc[]
